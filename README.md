# Technomancy Visualized

Interlinks ideas about technology, consciousness, cyberculture and magick to explore how humans and machines co-evolve meaning, power and awareness in the global knowledge economy.

## Overview

An interactive, force-directed knowledge graph built with React, TypeScript and D3 which visualizes an ecosystem of concepts and resources spanning technology, cyberculture, consciousness studies, magick, transhumanism and open-source philosophy. Idea nodes are connected to tag nodes representing shared themes, allowing users to explore relationships through highlighting and emphasis. Hovering over idea nodes reveals descriptions in a tooltip, while clicking them opens a side panel with descriptions and external links where available. The result is an interface for mapping intersections between technomancy, systems theory, cybernetics, psychedelics, open culture and emerging posthuman thought.
